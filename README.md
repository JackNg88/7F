# JMMG-NES Reprogramming: Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)

This repository contains **figures, scripts, and data analyses** related to our study on the induction of pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse embryonic fibroblasts using the JMMG-NES combination: **Jdp2, Jhdm1b, Mkk6, Glis1, Nanog, Essrb, Sall4**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore efficient reprogramming of MEFs into iPSCs using a defined set of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. This repository provides:

- Scripts for data processing, analysis, and figure generation  
- Figures for manuscript preparation  
- Supplementary analyses for gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and trajectory inference  

Our analyses focus on single-cell and bulk RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and integrative multi-omics approaches to characterize transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics during reprogramming.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/JMMG-NES_project.git

	2.	Install required packages:

# R example
install.packages(c("Seurat", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "Monocle3"))

# Python example
pip install pandas matplotlib scanpy anndata

	3.	Run scripts in the scripts/ folder to reproduce figures and analyses.

Key Computational Analyses
	•	Single-cell RNA-seq: preprocessing, clustering, marker identification, pseudotime and trajectory inference
	•	Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq): peak calling, annotation, and integration with transcriptional data
	•	Gene regulatory network reconstruction: identifying factor-driven transcriptional programs
	•	Figure generation: high-quality figures for publication and supplementary materials

These analyses were designed to reproduce and extend the findings of the JMMG-NES-mediated iPSC induction study, providing computational pipelines for transcriptomic and epigenetic data.
